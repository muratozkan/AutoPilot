# Auto Pilot


An experimental autopilot plugin aimed for in atmo control of aircraft for Kerbal Space Program.

### Planned features

I am conservative about plans right now. The basic functionality will cover:

* Hold altitude (in progress)
* Hold heading

* Hold / match speed

### Caution!

This mod is a work in progress and not intended for gameplay for some time.
